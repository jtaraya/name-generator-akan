    <h1>Name Generator (Akan)</h1>
    <p>
      Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries
      such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by
      factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth
      or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get
      irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is
      born. According to Akan tradition, each child is born with a name
      associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore
      determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of
      the Akan’s was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many
      people’s attention as they desire to know more about these names. As a
      matter of fact, it is possible to tell what led to someone’s birth, the
      day they were born and their rank among the siblings just by their names
